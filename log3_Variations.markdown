Now, all of that is great, but for something on the screen, it's extremely static! Let's make things move!


## Variation through variables
Up until now, we only put static numbers for the parameters of our drawing functions. That created static shapes, no surprise here! Now, we need to replace those numbers with things that can change. To that effect, we use variables. Instead of using a value, we're using something that holds a value, and can be either accessed or modified. For instance :


```javascript
	// We define/declare the variable here
let myVariable;

function setup() {
  	createCanvas(400, 400);
			// We instantiate the variable here (meaning we give it its first value
		myVariable = 0;
}

function draw() {

		// UPDATE
			// We update the value here
		myVariable = myVariable + 1;

		// DRAW
  	background(0,0,0);
			// We use the variable here
  	rect(myVariable, 10, 50, 50);
}
```

The magic keyword here is `let`, which allows you to create a variable. A variable is three things:
 * A **name**, here "myVariable";
 * A current **value**, its content, here "0" at the beginning
 * A **type** which is a way to read the content (bits -0/1- in memory, Javascript doesn't make you declare type, it's automated depending on the value you're using. Here it's a number.

Beware of the vocabulary in the comments. You first *define/declare* a variable to be able to use it, then you *instantiate* it to assure that there is a value (and not the void!) on it, and then you can *update/use* the variable in your code.

We will see later different types, but for now, let's keep with numbers. You can use more or less all mathematical operation that you can imagine:


```javascript
let myVariable, a, b;

function setup() {
  	createCanvas(400, 400);
		myVariable = 0;
		a = 2;
		b = 5;
}


function draw() {

		// UPDATE
			// Addition
		myVariable = a + b;

			// Substracion
		myVariable = a - b;

			// Multiplication
		myVariable = a * b;

			// Division
		myVariable = a / b;

			// You can use shortcut if you apply the modification to yourself
		
			// This line is the same as myVariable = myVariable + 1;
		myVariable += 1;

			// And as a test, can you guess what this operator is doing?
		myVariable = b%2;


		// DRAW
  	background(0,0,0);
			// We use the variable here
  	rect(myVariable, 10, 50, 50);
}
```

Last, I've separated our `draw` loop in two subsections, *update* and *draw*. It's not necessary, but it's a lovely way to organize your code. First you update your information, and then you display it.


## Variation through time
Variable are amazing, but if you want to control a bit better your movement, you should rely on a code that is executed in a loop, at every frame (because your computer might lag!) you want to rely on a common frame: time. For that, we use`millis()`, yet another function. What it does is pretty straight forward, `millis` returns the numbers of milliseconds that have elapsed since the beginning of the program, starting at 0.

Let's use that new function to control the position/size of our shapes! Beware, now that we want to have some evolving result, we want to code inside of `draw` instead of `setup`!


```javascript
function draw() {
  	background(0,0,0);
  	rect(millis(), 10, 50, 50);
}
```

That goes... pretty fast. Let's maybe use `millis()/1000` instead of `millis()` in our past code! This will divide the speed by 1000. You can try different numbers, or control other parameters from your code. Oh, and you remember those dreaded cosine and sine from math class?! They are actually pretty fun:

```javascript
function draw() {
    background(0,0,0);

		// Look how much we can combine functions inside one another!
    rect(100 + cos( millis() / 100 )*100, 10, 50, 50);
}
```

The point here is to experiment. You don't need to understand something to experiment, tweak and play with it. Even more: by experimenting and playing with it, you will get a better understanding. While understanding is often necessary to reach new height (or giving a less importance to chance on your way there), it's not a requirement to start doing.



## Variation through randomness
Randomness is awesome. Or should I say, itâ€™s seen as awesome. People look for patterns in everything, and project over the simplest or most random things! In p5.js, the basic function for randomness is the well named `rando)` function. You can call it with one parameter or two, as follow:

```javascript
random(max); // returns a decimal number between 0 and max
random(min, max); // returns a decimal number between min and max
```

As for `millis()`, anywhere in your code that had number can be replaced with randomness. Try it with colors, positions, sizes, etc. etc. If you want to refer to the size of your window, you can use two standard variables: `width` & `height`, used as follow:

```javascript
fill(random(255), random(255), random(255), random(255));
rect(random(width), random(height),50,50);
```


## Variation through keyboard

Another way to add variation is for yourself to be in control of what's happening! For that to happen, you need to feed information to the computer through controllers. Mouse, keyboard, touch-pads, mic, camera... A lot of possibilities! For now, let's look at mouse & keyboard.

P5.js allows direct access of the position of the mouse, through pre-named variable `mouseX` and `mouseY`. Don't try to modify those values, they are only for being read/used!

```javascript
function draw() {
    background(0,0,0);

    rect(mouseX, mouseY, 50, 50);
}
```

As easy as that! Try to apply that to different parameters of your code. If you want to trigger something (updating a value, drawing something, ...) you can do that with yet another pre-named function from p5.js called `mousePressed`, fitting name.

```javascript
function mousePressed() {
   //Do something when the mouse is pressed.

	 fill(255, 255, 255, 20);
	 ellipse(150 + random(100), 150 + random(100), 100, 100);

	// Just beware! if you're putting "background" in your draw loop,
	// ... you will only see that for a frame!
}
```


## Variation through keyboard

Unsurprisingly, we have a similar function for whenever we press a key on the keyboard:

```javascript
function keyPressed() {
   //Do something when a key is pressed.

}
```
Now, it's lovely to trigger something at a key press, but it would be even better if different key could do different things. For that we would need to test some new pre-named variable that would know which key we are typing, and to check if it fits the key that was meant to trigger a behavior. So we need two things. That new variable, and that `if` test.

That pre-named variable is called `key` and only accessible in the `keyPressed` function (and other function alike). In order what is stored in that value, we're going to display it in the console. A very lovely way to check what's happening in your program. For that, we use `console.log()`, don't worry too much about that weird dot for now.

```javascript
function keyPressed() {
		console.log(key);
}
```

Great, we're logging something. But... where? To see it, you need to open up your console, in your webdev tools. Depending on navigators, it could be opened up with *Ctr+Shift+I* or *Ctrl+Shift+J*. Once it's open, you will see a few tab in that new panel, click on *console*. And type away in you web app, you should see letters appearing in the console!

BONUS: if you want to access special keys, you might want to look into the pre-named variable `keyCode`!


## Variation through testing

We know variable, we know functions. And now, we are entering the main aspect of computation, the *why* of why is it called computation. The `if` keyword! What it does is as brilliant as it is simple: it tests for something, and do one thing if it's true (and optionally another if it's false). This is choice, the basic of artificial reasoning. After the if, a condition is tested among parenthesis, and among curly brackets (as with functions), the block of code that is to be executed. If you want to do something when something is not valid, then use *else* as done below. You can test many things with conditions. Equality with *===*, comparison with *<* and *>*... many more that you'll discover another time!


```javascript
function keyPressed() {
			//keyCodes: https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/keyCode 
		if (keyCode === LEFT_ARROW) {
			 background(255,random(255), 255);
		}
}

function keyTyped() {
		if (key === 'a') {
			 background(255,0, 255);
		} else if (key === 'b') {
			 background(255,255, 255);
		}
}
```

So, you should have enough here to create a little interactive game or experience, try to hone your skills at it, and we'll continue next time with new topics!
