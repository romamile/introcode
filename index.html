title:  "Welcome to your Intro to Code Workshop!"

<p>Hello everyone, I'm Roman Miletitch, and if you've opened the page as I mentioned it, I should be the guy talking right now!</p>

<p>Most, if not all, of what I'm going to write down here should have been addressed orally, so feel free to skip it, it is mostly meant as points of reference for you to go back to.</p>

<p>The structure of that course might be a bit different from what you are used to, and that relates to how programming works, and how it is usually learned. Not from a big lecture, but on a more personal level, through practice. Coding is a craft before anything else, and this course reflect that. This course/tutorial is meant to be followed by yourself, with no extra help. This means that in our courses, I will have time to engage one on one when someone has a specific issue, while most of the time you will be hands-on coding. This also means that you can continue working on the course on your side, and hone your skills before next sessions! I hope to be able to help you not just during our courses, but between them as well, for that, let's setup a discord!</p>

<p>This course will be divided in three sections (we'll see how that goes over 4 Tuesdays...)
<ol>
	<li><b>Discovering code</b> We'll use creative coding as a neat way to get introduced to coding, from setting up your environment, understanding basic principles, running your first program (youhou!), debugging, and having a graphical output;</li>
	<li><b>Specialization in code</b> In this section you will chose which topics you want to address. They are still to be determined, but will encompass XR, blockchain, and IA, depending on our first course!;</li>
	<li><b>Your own project</b> Now that you're an amazing coder, it's time to change the world with your skills; or at least have some little thing for your portfolio, you decide!</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>And now for something completely different. Some fundamental advice. Seriously.
<ol>
<li><b>Get your hands dirty.</b> You'll only learn if you write and run some code. Each piece of code shared has some meaning, would that be for educational purpose, or just to show some neat visualization. Run them all, and don't hesitate to tweak them, push them forward and explore both your sensibility and what you can do with it.</li>
<li><b>Understand what you're doing.</b> You need to understand each line of your code, especially in this workshop since we'll probably reuse them and make you modify them short after. If you're not 100% you understand, reread the course. Maybe try the next paragraph. Ask a fellow student, a coach, search online... Anything, but don't continue if you don't understand.</li>
<li><b>Understand what you're doing!</b> It's fundamental to understand the grammar of your lines of code, but it's as important to understand its meaning, and place in your code. You're coding your line at a specific place, it has a specific role. Understand that role. Not only of your line but also of your group of lines so that a structure of your code emerge. Sometimes you'll be asked to replace some code, it'll be up to you to understand what to replace.</li>
<li><b>Don't copy paste.</b> While it might seem as a quick way to advance the material, you will learn less. The more you will write, the more you will remember. And even better, whenever there are number used, try to tweak them, modify them a bit, see what happens.</li>
<li><b>Regularly clean your code.</b> It's easy to get lost, even more when you're discovering something new. Cleaning your code means getting rid (or commenting) unused part of the code, so you don't surcharge your code and wonder where is that specific part you're looking for. It means too organizing it, so you can infer better meaning from it. And last, the graphic structure. Don't forget to indent (put space at the start of the line) when you enter a new block of code, it eases both the reading and the spotting of bugs.</li>
<li><b>Learn how to search out the answer when you're stuck.</b> You are part of a group during the workshop, you can always ask the other students, or the coaches but it's a good reflex to always try to find out by yourself why there is an issue and how to solve it. You can search the reference page, tutorials, forums or even post a question online yourself (knowing how to post a good question would need its own tutorial too...).</li>
<li><b>A deal with the devil - ChatGPT</b> ChatGPT is a language model which basicaly act as a system that completes whatever text you send it. Among other things, it can code for you. Instead of fighting against it (or you using to cheat ;) ) we'll incorporate that tool to our practice!</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Now that we get to know each other, let's dive into the course itself.</p>
