## Web development VS Native development
Coding is not just writing done lines of code, it's understanding processes, knowing your tools, and knowing for what to develop! At a time, you didn't have much choice, you would develop natively (meaning, for a specific platform). Now, web browsers are so powerful that they are almost their own Operating System. As such, you can develop for them, developing directly for the web. Web pages aren't anymore just ways to provide information; they can be whole fetched experiences: a social media plateform, an online multiplayer game, a VR experience...

It can be hard to chose which to do, develop natively or on the web. Performances could be a reason to go native, maybe you don't have access to some specific things on a web browser... but the power of the net is usually sumed up in "developped once, run everywhere". While design might change, you can run the same webpage on a smartphone (iPhone or Android), a PC (Window, Mac, Linux), a VR headset... This accessibility is what is at the core of the web, this is why we will go in that direction for this course.


## Online web development tools
Having the result of your code online is great for sharing and accessibility. In the same sense, hosting your code online can be very helpful. Easy setup, very accessible, and some magic that is called "hot reloading". You don't need anymore to compile, or relaunch anything, your output is reloaded as you type. Magical!

There are many tools doing such wonders online ([codepen](https://codepen.io), [jsbin]([200~https://jsbin.com/)), the one I'm proposing is [glitch](https://glitch.com). First of all, create an account on glitch, and click on <b>new project</b> on the top right, and select <b>glitch hello website</b>. Congratulation, you've just "coded" your first website, you deserve a break!

We are going to use glitch as a 


Here we'll code as cooking. You'll discover a lot of new ingredients. It's normal to be a bit afraid to use them at first. The way we'll use to get to know them is to use them. More and more. Don't be afraid of making mistakes, we promise you, you can't break anything.

## 2) 4 paths of knowledge:
 * Skills. Tech skills.
 * Possibilities. Input, Output, Brains.
 * Scenography. The physical part of the virtual
 * Stylisation. Let's make my art mine. 

## 3) Our weapon of choixe

We'll be using P5JS Javascript. It's great, trust us. Long story short, it's taking inspiration from Processing, and inherit its ease of usage and utter fun to play with. Add to that a little present barely ever found in programming language, and there you have why we decided upon it.

While it won't be of use right now, you might want to get [the reference page](https://p5js.org/reference/) kept open somewhere. Good for inspiration, to check examples, and to learn about stuff.

And now for the most important, our lovely lively editor: [block builder](http://blockbuilder.org/). The little gem we talked earlier is called "hot reloading". This means that whenever you change your code, the result is updated live. While this might seem a defacto situation, it is not in most of user cases. Of course, this solution is not the best on each aspect, but for beginners it is god sent.
