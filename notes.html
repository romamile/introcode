HMKW

 - CTT - Divided in two, practice & theory

	 - Practice - Intro to creative coding
	 	- Tutorial first
	 	- Project second (think already about the projects)
	 				Ideas : game, experience, interactive design poster, CVs...

	 - Theory - Presentations about current trends
	 	=> need to finish that for next week...




1) Round table
	=> Name & one quick unique/quirky thing about you
	=> Why are you interested in this course?
	=> A current trend you're particularly curious about (the more specific the better)
	=> What kind of project you'd want to do?
	=> What are you afraid of in current tech?
		You're supposed to be the next gen of user/creators, you need to have a healthy doubt/fear of the tools you are using.
		Everything comes at a cost
	=> Any question


BUT FIRST ....
0) A bit about me
	- Freelance coder - virtual words for VR
	- Digital Artist - interactive instalations, experiences, projections...
	- Researcher in Artificial Intelligence

	I've changed 15 times flats in the past 3 years or so
	I love to teach, and here we have enogh leeway to create interesting things and explore/create
	Using tech and low tech to help people being more independant from big groups. (Farms, settlement, out of the grid...)
	I'd love to see something we can exhibit in the hallways
	It creates bigger divides, and is particularly linked with industrialisation, makes everhthing faster but rulling the issues we're having

		

2) The tools we'll be using (I propose, you tell me)
	=> Discord, to communicate
	=> Javascript + P5JS
		Live demo
	=> Glitch (register + always add me as a colaborator in your projects @romamile)
	=> Our course - https://romamile.github.io/introcode



3) A bit about LLM
	=> You need to use them, you need to learn how to collaborate with them
	ChatGPT - chat.openai.com
	Or we can search for other possibilites



4) How to start code in the best way ever	
	Get your hands dirty.
	Understand what you're doing. Understand each line of your code.
	Understand what you're doing! Understand the place of each line of your code.
	Don't copy paste.
	Regularly clean your code. 
	Learn when & how to search out an answer when you're stuck



5) Let's start!!!
